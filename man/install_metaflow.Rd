\usage{
install_metaflow(
  method = c("virtualenv", "conda", "auto"),
  conda = "auto",
  version = "default",
  envname = "r-metaflow",
  extra_packages = NULL,
  restart_session = TRUE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{method}{Installation method. Can be "auto", "virtualenv", or "conda".
This affects the type of environment created, but Metaflow will always
be installed via pip.}

\item{conda}{Path to conda executable (only applicable if method = "conda")}

\item{version}{Metaflow version to install. Use "default" for the latest
version, or specify a version like "2.12.23" or "2.11.6".}

\item{envname}{Name of the virtual/conda environment to install packages
into. Default is "r-metaflow".}

\item{extra_packages}{Additional Python packages to install along with
Metaflow}

\item{restart_session}{Restart R session after installing (only in RStudio)}

\item{python_version}{Python version to use. Must be >= 3.8.}

\item{new_env}{Whether to create a new environment or use an existing one}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to reticulate installation functions}
}
\value{
This function returns NULL invisibly. The primary side effect is the
installation of Metaflow and its dependencies in the specified environment.
}
\description{
\code{install_metaflow()} installs the Metaflow Python package and its
direct dependencies from PyPI using pip. This function provides a convenient
way to set up Metaflow within an R environment.
}
\details{
This function installs Metaflow from PyPI using pip, regardless of whether
a virtualenv or Conda environment is used. If a Conda environment is
specified, the function will create a Conda environment but still use pip to
install Metaflow within that environment.

The function performs several checks and steps:
\itemize{
\item Verifies that the system is not Windows (not supported)
\item Checks and sets the appropriate Python version
\item Prepares the installation environment (new or existing)
\item Installs Metaflow and any additional specified packages
}
